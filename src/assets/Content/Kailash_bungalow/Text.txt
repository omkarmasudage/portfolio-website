‘Kailash’ bungalow captures the essence of Lord Shiva’s sacred hometown. Just as Mount Kailash is a place of spiritual significance and tranquility, our bungalow embodies these qualities , offering a peaceful retreat that resonates with divine aura of its namesake. Just as pilgrims are drawn to the serenity of Mount Kailash, residents of ‘Kailash’ bungalow will experience a similar sense of calm, connection & harmony.


The concept draws inspiration from contemporary minimalist architecture, rooted in ancient Vastu Shastra principles, providing well ventilated & well lighted spaces.


Balconies are extended along a lateral axis, facing the surrounding hills. The master bedroom maximizes its carpet area by omitting a terrace, yet offers an exterior view through a window-cum-balcony.
